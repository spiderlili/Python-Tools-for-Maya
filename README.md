Plug-ins to speed up work and not having to redo redundant tasks.

## Object Renamer
Add suffixes to objects in the scene so they can be identified without looking at the outliner.<br>
Renaming nodes: It can confuse Maya when more complex connections are made between nodes. Use the object rename tool to rename the child nodes so everything in the scene has a unique name. Nodes on the same level of the hierarchy can't have the same name. It's a bad idea for the child nodes to have the same name.
